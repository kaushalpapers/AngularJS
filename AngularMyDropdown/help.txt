1. In mydropdown.js,  copy from line# 9 to line#19, paste in your code
2. In mydropdown.js,  go to setValue() function, add extra condition where we are setting value to textbox. 
3. The element on which you want dropdown, must have first value already filled up and must have tabindex attribute

 Note: Just for your knowledge, Added extra condtion in step-02 that 
    checks if the element is not textbox(input - tagName), then it should be div, so we are setting html not value.
