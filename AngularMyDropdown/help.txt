1. In mydropdown.js,  copy from line# 9 to line#19, paste in your code
2. In mydropdown.js,  go to setValue() function, add extra condition where we are setting value to textbox. 
    Note: Added extra condtion that 
    checks if the element is not textbox(input - tagName), then it should be div, so we are setting html not value.
3. The element on which you want dropdown, must have first value filled up and must have tabindex attribute
